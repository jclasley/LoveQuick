### About

I'm the worst at keeping in touch with friends and family. I wish I could be better and have long, extended conversations with those that I care about dearly, but life and its numerous distractions get in the way.

I wished that I had a way to quickly drop a line to my parents, my siblings, and my college roomates to simply say "Hey, just thinking about you, hope you're doing alright." Sure, I could type out that text, but before you know it, we're exchanging texts and then I forget to reply and now I feel bad because I forgot to reply and you feel bad because I forgot to reply and nobody's happy.

Enter LoveQuick.

### How it works

After you sign up, you'll be given random LoveLetters, which you can see in your profile. This set of five characters will be how your friends and loved ones add you to their LoveList.

The first time you run the app, you'll be given a quick tour that culminates in you being given the option of changing your display name. After you've confirmed your display name, you're good to go! Start by adding some people to your LoveList.

Once you have some users in your LoveList, all you have to do is tap the heart! You'll be given a confirmation that your love has been sent, and any user on your LoveList will receive a notification that you're thinking about them. It's as simple as that.

### Why it's different

LoveQuick was designed specifically to be unintrusive. I didn't want this to become just another way that I fail to stay in touch with people. All it is and all it will ever be is a quick, easy, minimally invasive way to send a virtual thought. To keep it this way, there are restrictions on how often you can send and receive.  
<dl>
<dt>Sending</dt>
<dd>You can only send out a notification once an hour. The notification will go to everyone on your list, but you have to wait an hour to do it again. This is to keep it from being a game of tag.</dd>  
<dt>Receiving</dt>
<dd>Your notifications are queued such that you will only receive push notifications hourly, at maximum. Not a notification every single time you are on a user's list who sends love. The notifications are grouped and then pushed on a schedule. You can review your notifications at any time by opening the app, which is the only way to receive real-time info.</dd>
